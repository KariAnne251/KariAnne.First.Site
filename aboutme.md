My name is Kari Yunt. I'm really trying to up my skills in data analytics and program evaluation.

- I have been workig in program delivery for 10 years, and know how to move from ideas to action.
- I have been writing grants, fundraising and asking people for money since I was 10 years old and needed mission trip sponsorships.
- And now, I am well practiced in using regression modling to asses causal relationships and intervention imapct.
